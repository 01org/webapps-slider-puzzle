BUILD FOR TIZEN

To build a deployable Tizen package, you will need Linux,
node and grunt. Once these are installed, follow these steps:

1. Install build-time dependencies with: npm install .
2. Create the package by running: grunt wgt (optimised package
   with minified js and css) or grunt sdk (unminified)
3. Install the package with: grunt install.

Alternatively, you can use these shortcuts to install the wgt or sdk
packages respectively:

  grunt wgt-install
  grunt sdk-install

BUILD FOR SDK

To build a set of files suitable for use with the SDK, follow
the build steps above then run the "grunt sdk" task.

The SDK build is copied to the build/sdk directory. This contains
just the files needed to provide an example application for use
with the Tizen SDK.
