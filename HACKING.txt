BUILD FOR TIZEN

To build a deployable Tizen package, you will need Linux,
node and grunt. Once these are installed, follow these steps:

1. Install build-time dependencies with: npm install .
2. Create the package by running: grunt wgt (optimised package
   with minified js and css) or grunt sdk (unminified)

The package is built in the build/ directory. You can deploy
this package manually using sdb.

Alternatively, use the deployment script deploy.sh
to build the package and deploy it to an attached Tizen device.

BUILD FOR SDK

To build a set of files suitable for use with the SDK, follow
the build steps above then run the "grunt sdk" task.

The SDK build is copied to the build/sdk directory. This contains
just the files needed to provide an example application for use
with the Tizen SDK.
