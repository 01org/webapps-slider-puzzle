BUILD FOR TIZEN

To build a deployable Tizen package, you will need Linux,
node and grunt. Once these are installed, follow these steps:

1. Install build-time dependencies with: npm install .
2. Create the package by running: grunt pkg

The package is built in the build/ directory. You can deploy
this package manually using sdb.

Alternatively, use the deployment script deploy.sh
to build the package and deploy it to an attached Tizen device.
